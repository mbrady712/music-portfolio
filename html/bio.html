        <p>Pianist and teacher Michael Brady has enjoyed a rich musical
            career. Originally from Baltimore, Maryland, he began learning piano at age eight with
            Phyllis Jovich and started studying with Dr. Michael Adcock at 15. He holds a Bachelor
            of Music from the University of Texas at Austin, and a Master of Music from Texas State
            University, where he studied with Gregory Allen and Jason Kwak, respectively.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brady has given recitals around the country and abroad. He has performed in the
            Clear Creek Music Festival in Halfway, Oregon and the Vivace Music Festival in
            Wilmington, North Carolina. Additionally, Mr. Brady was accepted into the prestigious
            2019 summer piano intensive program at the Accademia Chigiana, in Siena, Italy, where
            he studied with Boris Berman and Carol Leone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brady has performed in masterclasses with Leon Fleisher, Robert Shannon, Peter

            Brownell, Anton Nel, and Collette Valentine in addition to several community
            outreaches.</p>
        <p>In addition to classical music, Mr. Brady is skilled in popular and jazz music. In high
            school, he played keyboard with the marching band and other student groups, performing
            pop, funk, and other contemporary genres. At UT Austin, he took three semesters of jazz
            piano lessons with Professor Jeffrey Hellmer and Dr. Ross Margitza. He also performed
            in the UT jazz combo program.</p>
        <p>As a teacher, Mr. Brady has worked with a wide variety of students and educators. During his undergraduate, he taught children piano as part of the UT Piano Project,
            directed by Professor Sophia Gilmson. A former teacher at the Orpheus Academy of
            Music in Austin, TX, he is well versed in the Kodaly approach as taught by Dr. Klondike
            Steadman, director of the academy.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Brady is currently working towards becoming a web developer, he
            continues to perform in Austin, TX. He hopes to continue to develop his skills as a
            musician to help others develop their own love for music.</p>
